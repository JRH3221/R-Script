# R-Script
Compiled language for writing fast code for different robotics platforms.

Current branch is **python-compiler**. Python compiler will be made first as to first get around the syntax tree without worrying too much about the lexion issues. The next compiler will compile to C code, then it will be further compiled to machine code using existing C compilers. The ultimate goal is to compile all the way to machine code and do as much cleanup and optimization as possible. But for now using existing C compilers will get better results.
